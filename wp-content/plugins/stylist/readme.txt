* 🏳 Initial Beta Release

This plugin is a rewritten from scratch fork of the *Yellow Pencil* Lite plugin by WaspThemes. As theme developers, we wanted to use Yellow Pencil in our projects but needed to make it much simpler for our clients. Unfortunately, Yellow Pencil code didn't provide enough filters and hooks to extend it without forking/code rewrite. The plugin's code is not-extendable and not suitable for modern JavaScript development (ReactJS). Our form of the plugin is much simpler and limited in functionality comparing to Yellow Pencil. We left only features that Gutenberg users really need and re-code everything using ReactJS framework used by the Gutenberg developers. Thank you, WaspThemes for all the ideas shared with open source community through GPL-based Yellow Pencil Lite plugin.

StylistWp is a much simpler styling plugin oriented for Gutenberg users. On other hands, Yellow Pencil is excellent for advanced web developers who don't care about extendability. Go and check their plugin to see if it's a better option for you.
